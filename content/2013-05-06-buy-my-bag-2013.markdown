It’s that time again. Time for you to buy my bag. I’ve got a 2011 Tom Bihn
Ristretto for 13" MacBook Pro (same structure as their
[Original Style Ristretto](http://www.tombihn.com/PROD/TB0231.html), but
larger). It’s Cocoa with Cayenne interior, and it has the Absolute Shoulder
Strap. It’s in fabulous condition, and it really, really wants to live at your
house. One solitary Benjamin is all that separates you from this beautiful bag.
