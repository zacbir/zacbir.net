### “ExternalEditor: Because no one should have to use &lt;textarea&gt;”

Long ago, Casey Duncan wrote a Zope 2 product called ExternalEditor. It let
users of Linux and Windows designate local apps to edit Zope-hosted content. As
a budding OS X developer, and a user of Zope, I ported it to OS X using the
PyObjC framework and called it ZopeEditManager.  Periodically, as OS X versions
came along, ZopeEditManager needed to be patched and resuscitated.

As it happens, I’m now doing some contract work with Zope, and found it needed
another update for Mountain Lion, so I’ve rolled out another version. And since
it doesn’t seem to be on the Zope Foundation list of a million GitHub
repositories, I’ll be hosting it again under my
[Orangutango repositories](https://github.com/orangutango/Zem).
